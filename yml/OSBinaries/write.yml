    Description: Executes a binary provided in default value of (HKCU|HKLM):\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\App Paths\wordpad.exe.
    Usecase: This might be utilized to confuse detection solutions that rely on parent-child relationships (process will be spawned as a child to the write.exe). HKCU is checked first, allowing for user exploitation.
