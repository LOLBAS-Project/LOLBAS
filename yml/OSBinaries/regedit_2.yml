Author: Eron Clarke
Created: 2024-09-26
Commands:
  - Command: regedit.exe
    Description: Upon execution, regedit.exe checks two registry values at HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Classes\exefile\Shell\open\command; if these are set by an attacker, the set command will be executed as a high-integrity process without a UAC prompt being displayed to the user. See 'resources' for which registry keys/values to set.
    Usecase: Execute a binary or script as a high-integrity process without a UAC prompt.
