  - Command: SettingSyncHost -LoadAndRunDiagScriptNoCab anything
    Description: Execute a batch script in the background (no window ever pops up) which can be subverted to running arbitrary programs by setting the current working directory to %TMP% and creating files such as reg.bat/reg.exe in that directory thereby causing them to execute instead of the ones in C:\Windows\System32.
    Usecase: Can be used to evade defensive countermeasures or to hide as a persistence mechanism. Additionally, effectively act as a -WindowStyle Hidden option (as there is in PowerShell) for any arbitrary batch file.
